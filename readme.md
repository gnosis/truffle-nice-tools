## Truffle-nice-tools
A very simple, yet *nice* CLI interface toolkit for  [Truffle Framework](https://truffleframework.com/) development.

(Note: this toolkit uses the excellent new NPX feature of NPM to save you from a useless global install. Don't be shy. The format is npx \<command>)

### Install
Run `npm i -D @gnosis.pm/truffle-nice-tools` inside your [Truffle Framework](https://truffleframework.com/) project.

---
Commands
-----

##### Generic
```
npx tnt help <command>, npx tnt -h........Opens the help menu. 
```
Find all the options and flags availabble in individual commands by running npx tnt \<commandname>. 
```
npx tnt version, npx tnt -v...............Check the version.
```
---
##### Network Extraction / Injection
```
npx tnt extractNetworks, npx tnt eN <options>.......Extracts relevant network data from your build/contracts repository. Storing it in networks.json.
npx tnt injectNetworks, npx tnt iN <options>........Injects the stored data from the networks.json file into the build/contracts ABI files via merge (it will overwrite conflicts, be warned)
```

##### Decoding
```
npx tnt decodeTransactions, npx tnt dT <options>....Decodes the transactions which have occured on your network of choice.  
```
* In order to decode transactions, you will need to have an Ethereum network running, we check for port 8545 by default but if you would like to connect to a network at a different port, please simply update your process.env.CHAINPORT environment variable to the port of your Ethereum network.

* By default, it is assumed your .json ABI files are located at `/build/contracts`. If you would like to change your ABI folder, please simply change the process.env.ABIFOLDER environment variable. 

##### Gas Benchmarking
The Gas Benchmarking module is created to give you more accurate `gas cost` representation stats, through injecting gas collection stats into your tests and outputting the data. 

  * ( The first index holds the contract for gas measurements, the second index holds its inheritance tree. This list should be topologically sorted for maximum benchmarking efficiency. )
1. Execute this command:

```
npx tnt measureGas, npx tnt mG <options>..........This will generate benchmarks for your function gas usage, derived from your test cases. The stats are stored at `build/gas/gas-stats.json` by default, but may be modified with the `-o` option:
``` 

* (Optional) Create a JSON file holding a mapping (preferably topologically sorted) of your contract heirarchy you want benchmarked in the format shown below:
```
npx tnt measureGas -f <path to .json mapping file> -o <path to your desired gas-stats location>
```

###### Example Inheritance Map
```
{
    "Event": ["CategoricalEvent", "ScalarEvent"],
    "StandardMarket": ["StandardMarketWithPriceLogger"],
    "Market": ["StandardMarket"],
    "MarketMaker": ["LMSRMarketMaker"],
    "Oracle": [
        "CentralizedOracle",
        "DifficultyOracle",
        "FutarchyOracle",
        "MajorityOracle",
        "SignedMessageOracle",
        "UltimateOracle"
      ],
    "StandardToken": ["EtherToken", "OutcomeToken"],
    "Token": ["StandardToken"]
}

*(Pro-Tip: If you are having errors with compiling, npx will attempt to use the local Truffle install, make sure your compiler versions are the same, if you are normally using a global Truffle install. )*
